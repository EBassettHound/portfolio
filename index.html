        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I spent a few years in undergraduate studies pursuing a computer science degree before stepping away due to personal struggles during the COVID-19 pandemic. The years that followed I worked jobs in restuarants, moving companies, and masonries while to trying to jumpstart a career in the tech sector. I am very grateful to have found the Thinkful program for the opportunity to become a software engineer and learn web development.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time I enjoy making music and have spent many years training as an endurance athlete. I love most genres of music but tend to lean towards rock and hiphop. My favorite aspect of creating new projects is getting to meet and work with so many talented people. I began my journey as a competitive runner in high school and was able to take my passion to the collegiate level as a D1 athlete. I am forever grateful for the people I was able to train with and learn from while I was part of a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are a few passions and lessons learned from my personal life as a musician and athlete that I am excited to carry over into my professional life as developer:
